# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 13 February 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about sitemaps and how to make create sql databases for mvc .net projects.

**Thoughts:** I didn't know anything about sitemaps before other than to let search engines know about links. Today I got to fiddle around with it at work. I haven't learned much in my free time recently as I have been incredibly busy. I got my hands on project I wanted to make for a while which is my blog. I didn't do as much as I wished to as Visual studio needed updates and it took ages :( Will be written in mvc .net with razor, bootstrap and jquery. So far I have done the front end part. I want to start with making long in and registration system.

**Link to work:** At work/ nothing to commit yet and I don't want to put just front end yet as I want to split it to partials + I am tired.
